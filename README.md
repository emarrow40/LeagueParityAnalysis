# LeagueParityAnalysis

## 1. Project Introduction and Goals

To explore how intra-league competitiveness in Europe's Top 5 Leagues has evolved over time, I have analyzed their season tables since the 1992/1993 
season and have calculated a variety of metrics to measure parity and the degree of balance/imblance within each league.

Through conducting this analysis my aim was to further refine my skills working with APIs, processing data with pandas, and generating dashboards in popular BI
platforms. Below is an outline of the project's data extraction, transformation, and visualization.
